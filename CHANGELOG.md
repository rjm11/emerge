The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.5.7] - 2025-08-07

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed race condition in `checkAllUpdates()` function
- `emodule update` now properly waits for async operations to complete
- Manager update checks no longer use stale cache data (force refresh)
- Added proper timeout protection (10s total, 8s per download)
- Fixed race where `pending_update` was evaluated before download completion

### Changed
- Replaced fixed 3-second timer with proper event-driven async coordination
- `checkSelfUpdate()` now delegates to new async version for consistency
- Cache refresh now forces fresh data during update checks (`force=true`)
- Improved error messages with timeout and network issue detection

### Added
- New `checkSelfUpdateAsync()` method with callback-based completion
- Completion state tracking to coordinate multiple async operations
- Individual download timeout protection with cleanup
- Better debug output showing progress of async operations
